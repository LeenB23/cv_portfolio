After acquiring a Masters in Creative Writing at the University of Glasgow,
she stuck around and is now writing a doctoral thesis that aims to uncover how
fantasy fiction exposes social injustice while writing her own fantasy/surreal
stories alongside her research. Her poetry and short stories have appeared
in numerous online and print anthologies, including Crooked Holster, SWAMP
Magazine, and Toad Suck Review. She has lived in Austria, the Netherlands,
and now lives in the UK.
